# MangeCourses-Project2

*This project is similar to ManageCourses-Project1, the difference is the complexity of the functions of this data structere. 

*The purpose is to implement a data structure that helps manage courses.

*The user can add/remove courses, lectures or the time watched for each lecture. Also the user can get data such as number of the classes, getting the i'th most-watched class, etc. All of this features were implemented in efficient way (time-complexity wise)

*The project implements AVL rank tree, list, hash table without using STL.
